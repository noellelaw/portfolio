        Zachary Hicks, Jason Ashley, Eleanor Ozer and I undertook the "Robotany" that integrates embedded systems interfacing, house plant physiology, 
        robotics and machine vision, and earned the Louis T. Rader Chairperson's Award for Best Capstone. This cybernetic plant autonomously tracked moisture levels, monitored growth,
        and moved based on its lighting needs.

        My primary role was as follows: 
        - Implemented a control algorithm in C using an ISR task scheduler to integrate light sensors, bump switches, cliff sensors, and the plantâ€™s bioelectrochemical signals. 
        - Designed a computer vision algorithm with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Python to isolate the plant from a user background, remove glare, and determine the growth levels of the plant for electrode placement and harvesting. 
        - Transmitted plant data via a WiFi module to be displayed on a user application.
